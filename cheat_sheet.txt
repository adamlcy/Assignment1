The game is straightforward.

The player will grab items from the surroundings and explore the area.
(The phrases in the round brackets are the command following the explanation of what it does.)

There are two different endings, but both will go through some same steps:

First, after wake up from the bedroom, 
	grab the living room key on the desk (look around) and take the note from the closet (open closet).
Then go to the hallway (go outside).
Next check the shoe cabinate (check shoe cabinate) to grab another note. 
Then go the the living room (go living room) and grab the reb book from the sofa (sit on the sofa).
	You can check the fireplace (check fireplace) to get a match, or go to the kitchen to check around to get matches.
Next, go outside (go backyard) and grab the last note (check tree).

Then you can burn the book (burn book) or the notes (burn notes) depending on which ending you are going for.

(Good Ending)
If you burn the book,
	you will get the book ashes, then go to the living room (go inside) and then to the hallway (go hallway),
		and turn into the bathroom (go bathroom). Last, dump the book ashes here (dump the book ashes),
		you will see the good ending.
		
(Bad Ending)
If you burn the notes,
	you will get the notes ashes, stay in the backyard and dump the notes ashes right here (dump the notes ashes).
	The game will restart.
